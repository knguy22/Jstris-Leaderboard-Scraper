# Jstris Leaderboard Scraper

The purpose is to provide a complete collection of replays of any given gamemode on Jstris. This project is meant to be run 
from the ```src``` directory, and the settings of the scraper can be found and modified from ```src/main.py```. In addition, a ```header.txt``` file containing an identification header for the scraper is required. I will not be providing the header that I use for all my scrapers. 

Much of the code used for this scraper comes from the work done on my [Discord bot](https://github.com/knguy22/Jstris-Stats-Discord-Bot).
